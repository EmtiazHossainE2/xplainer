# 1. Cost-based pricing

I come from a Baniya family. The rules of traditional businesses are simple - *Lagat (total cost) + Labh (profit).*

*To understand cost-based pricing, let’s understand a few boring micro-economics concepts first!*

> Variable costs are the costs that changes with how little or more you produce. e.g:- wages. If you produce less, you would need fewer workers and in turn spend less on wages.
> 
> 
> Fixed costs are the costs that don’t vary with how much or little you produce. *Think of the offfice space you have leased for a year.*
> 
> Mark up is the fancy name for profit.
> 

Cost-based pricing is simple. Suppose you have created a cohort-based course on React.js with the production cost of each unit (course) being ₹ 250. *You want a 50% profit over it.* You sell it for ₹ 375. That’s it. That is cost-based pricing.

The cost to produce your React.js course is always too little. *It makes absolutely no sense to price it by cost + markup approach.*

Also as a tech company, after a certain scale, your cost of producing additional units almost approaches zero.

*Hence, cost-based pricing suits traditional (non-tech) businesses more.*

### 1.1 Cost-based pricing as a competitive advantage

Recently, I stumbled upon an e-apparel website - [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/about). It was a usual apparel website unless the tagline caught my attention - *Ethical factories. Radical transparency.*

Scrolling down, their pricing section blew my mind! They mentioned their **total cost from manufacturing to end mile delivery** and added a 211% profit (markup) on the production cost.

*Much honesty? Right!* They were also kind enough to mention that their competitors are booking 400% profit. **See we are booking less profit!**

Everlane is a very interesting example of how pricing strategy can be a pure-play innovation and is an art in the true sense.

### 1.2 Should you cover up your costs?

*Covering up the costs makes absolute sense when you are bootstrapping or have no access to external capital.* You need to cover up the expenses of running your business. You need to issue a paycheck every month.

> Covering up costs is not a choice but a quest of survival.
> 

The story is altogether different if you chasing growth *(trying to grab a large pie of the market (fast! faster!)* with piles of cash in the bank.

Let’s see the next pricing strategy - **value-based pricing**.

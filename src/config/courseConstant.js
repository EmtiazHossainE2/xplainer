        London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and
        change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and
        Google to teach their employees.
        
        My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game.
        Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my greatest
        passion is teaching.`,
